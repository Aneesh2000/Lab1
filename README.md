**Simple MicroBlog**

This simple MicroBlog will be the basis for our future assignments using replication and message broker.

Simple Microblog will have two parts: 
1) a SpringBoot server that will service REST requests and
2) a SpringBoot CLI that clients will use to interact with the service.
Messages

**API's :**
```
POST MESSAGE:
POST request to /messages/create
request:
{
 "date": "2024-03-13T19:38-07:00",

 "signature": "as/f32230FS+"
}
response:

}
LIST MESSAGES:
POST request to /messages/list
request:

 "next": -1 // -1 is the last message. messages come in reverse order
}

}
response:
{ message: "welcome" }
PUBLIC KEY REQUEST:
GET request to /user/username/public-key
returns the PEM encoded public key.
GENERAL ERROR RESPONSE:
{
 "error": "signature didn't match"
}
```
**Message signing**

We will do message signature similar to mastodon: https://docs.joinmastodon.org/spec/security/
(https://docs.joinmastodon.org/spec/security/) The digest will be calculated over the JSON of the
message with the fields "date", "author", "message", and "attachment" in that order. All whitespace for
formatting must be removed before calculating the SHA-256 digest and signed with RSA.
sbdown dependency.

You will need to include the sbdown jar in your server jar file. You will need to include the package for the
class in scan annotation as shown in the skeleton code checked into your repo. It exposes an /ruok
endpoint. We will use it in grading to see if your server is running. If you are exposing endpoints explicity
in nginx, make sure you allow arbitrary arguments (like /ruok?xyz=123).

**CLI**

Your CLI will have 3 subcommand:

post message [file-to-attach] \

if file-to-attach is given, it will be base64 encoded before sending to the server. \
list [--starting id] [--count number] [--save-attachment]\
if --save-attachment is given, a file will be created with the base64 decoded attachment named message-id.out \
the number of messages to retrieve may be greater than 20, so you may need to make additional
requests under the covers. number defaults to 10. \
if --starting is not give, start at the end. \
messages will be listed in the following way: \
100: 2024-03-13T19:38-07:00 author_name says "this message may go multiple lines
that's okay. make sure to end with a quote. if there is an attachment
put a ðŸ“Ž emoji after the quote and a space." ðŸ“Ž \
create userid \
will generate a public key pair and save the userid and private key to a mb.ini file that will be used
later by post and list if the create is successful. the userid must consist of only lowercase letters
and numbers.
